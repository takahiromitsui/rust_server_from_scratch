# Rust Server(Chatapp) from Scratch

Rust has "TcpListener" in the standard library to set up a TCP connection.

In this repo, I aim to build an HTTP server from scratch without using "TcpListener" (instead, I created MyTcpListener) and gradually convert it to a chat app.

I attempt to do network programming in Rust for the sake of learning.
I referred to a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/from-the-scratch/http-server-what-do-you-need-to-know-to-build-a-simple-http-server-from-scratch-d1ef8945e4fa) about building an HTTP server in C language (the step numbers in my code indicate steps in the blog).
